In contrast with the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about the Kingdom of the East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement.[REPLACED] The main primary sources for information about Anna's life and reign are the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in Northumbria by Bede in REPLACED, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna's death. The mediaeval work known as the Liber Eliensis, written in Ely in the twelfth century, is a source of information about Anna's daughters ¨¡thelthryth and Seaxburh, and also describes Anna's own death and burial.[REPLACED] Anna was the son of Eni, a member of the ruling Wuffingas family, and nephew of R©¡dwald, king of the East Angles from REPLACED to REPLACED.[REPLACED] East Anglia was an early and long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom in which a duality of a northern and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.[REPLACED]
Anna was married, according to Bede, who refers to the saint S©¡thryth as "daughter of the wife of Anna, king of the East Angles".[REPLACED] In Abbott Folcard's Life of St Botolph, written in the REPLACEDREPLACEDth century, Botolph is described as having been at one time the chaplain to the sisters of a king, ¨¡thelmund, whose mother was named S©¡wara. Folcard names two of S©¡wara's kinsmen as ¨¡thelhere and ¨¡thelwold. Since these are the names of two of Anna's brothers, Steven Plunkett suggests that it is "tempting" to consider that S©¡wara was married to Anna, and that ¨¡thelmund might either be Anna's full name, or the name of an otherwise unknown East Anglian sub-king.[REPLACED] The Liber Eliensis names Hereswith, the sister of Hild, abbess of Whitby, as Anna's wife and the mother of S©¡thryth, Seaxburh of Ely and ¨¡thelthryth.[REPLACED] However, the Liber Eliensis is regarded with caution by historians: Rosalind Love says that the mediaeval writers who interpreted Bede's information about Hereswith made an "erroneous assumption" regarding her connection with Anna and his family.[REPLACED][REPLACED] Historians now believe that Hereswith was Anna's sister-in-law and that around the time that she married into the East Anglian royal family, Anna had already been king for a decade.[REPLACED]
In REPLACED Anna was probably at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections,[REPLACEDREPLACED] and, according to the Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter ¨¡thelthryth.[REPLACEDREPLACED] By tradition, ¨¡thelthryth is said to have been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.[REPLACEDREPLACED]During REPLACED or REPLACED Edwin of Northumbria, with his centre of Christian power north of the River Humber, was overthrown. Edwin was slain and Northumbria was ravaged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, supported by the Mercian king, Penda.[REPLACEDREPLACED] The Mercians then turned on the kingdom of the East Angles and their king, Ecgric. At an unknown date (possibly in the early REPLACEDs),[REPLACEDREPLACED] they routed the East Anglian army and Ecgric and his predecessor Sigeberht were both slain.[REPLACEDREPLACED] D. P. Kirby has suggested that as Sigeberht was alive when the Irish monk Fursey left for Gaul and found Erchinoald, (which happened after Erchinoald became Mayor of the Neustrian palace in REPLACED), Sigeberht was probably killed around REPLACED or REPLACED.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Penda's victory marked the end of the line of kings of the East Angles who were directly descended from R©¡dwald.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Some time after Penda's victory, Anna became king of the East Angles, though the date of his accession is quite uncertain. The Liber Eliensis says that Anna died in the nineteenth year of his reign, and since he died in the mid-REPLACEDs this would indicate a date around REPLACED.[REPLACEDREPLACED] However, the Liber Eliensis is regarded by some historians as unreliable on this point,[REPLACED] and Barbara Yorke suggests a possible date in the early REPLACEDs for Anna's accession, noting that it could not have been after REPLACED as Anna is recorded as giving refuge to Cenwalh of Wessex in that year.[REPLACEDREPLACED][note REPLACED] It is probable that Anna became king with the assistance of the northern Angles.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Throughout his reign he was the victim of Mercian aggression under Penda, but he also seems to have challenged the rise of Penda's power.[REPLACEDREPLACED] The British medievalist David Dumville has written that due to their rivalry for control over the Middle Anglian people, Mercia and East Anglia probably became hereditary enemies and Penda repeatedly attacked the East Angles from the mid-REPLACEDs to REPLACED.[REPLACEDREPLACED]
Anna arranged an important diplomatic marriage between his daughter Seaxburh and Eorcenberht of Kent, cementing an alliance between the two kingdoms.[REPLACEDREPLACED] It was by means of marriages such as this that the kings of Kent could become well-connected to other royal dynasties.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Not all of Anna's daughters were married into other royal families. During the REPLACEDs Anna's daughter ¨¡thelburg and his stepdaughter S©¡thryth entered Faremoutiers Abbey in Gaul to live religious lives under abbess Fara.[REPLACEDREPLACED] The first royal Anglo-Saxons to become nuns, they made religious seclusion "an acceptable and desirable vocation for ex-queens and royal princesses", according to Barbara Yorke.[note REPLACED]
D. P. Kirby uses the presence of East Anglian princesses living under the veil in Gaul as evidence of the Frankish orientation of Anna's kingdom at this time, continued since the reign of his predecessor R©¡dwald.[REPLACEDREPLACED] The Wuffingas dynasty may have been connected with monastic foundations in the area around Faramoutiers through Anna's predecessor Sigeberht, who had spent several years as an exile in Gaul and had become a devout and learned Christian due to his experiences of monastic life.[REPLACEDREPLACED] The kingdom of East Anglia during the reign of Anna
In REPLACED Oswald of Northumbria was slain in battle by Penda (probably at Oswestry in Shropshire). Due to his death, Northumbria was split into two. The northern part, Bernicia, accepted Oswald's brother Oswiu as their new king, but the southern Deirans refused to accept him and were ruled instead by a king of the original Deiran house, Oswine.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Soon afterwards Cenwalh of Wessex, the brother of Oswald's widow and himself married to Penda's sister, renounced his wife.[REPLACEDREPLACED] In REPLACED, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda drove Cenwalh from his kingdom and into exile. During the following year, while a refugee at Anna's court, he was converted to Christianity,[REPLACEDREPLACED] returning in REPLACED to rule Wessex as a Christian king.[REPLACED] Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.[REPLACEDREPLACED]
Anna's hold on the western limits of his kingdom, which bordered on the Fen lands that surrounded the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in REPLACED (or slightly later) of his daughter ¨¡thelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South Gyrwe, a people living in the fens who may have been settled in the area around Ely.[REPLACEDREPLACED][note REPLACED] ¨¡thelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.[REPLACEDREPLACED] 
During his reign Anna endowed the monastery at Cnobheresburg with rich buildings and objects.[REPLACEDREPLACED] The monastery was built in about REPLACED by Fursey after he arrived in East Anglia. In time, weary of attacks on the kingdom, Fursey left East Anglia for good, leaving the monastery to his brother Foillan.[REPLACEDREPLACED] When in REPLACED Penda attacked the monastery, Anna and his men arrived and held the Mercians back. This gave Foillan and his monks enough time to escape with their books and valuables, but Penda defeated Anna and drove him into exile, possibly to the kingdom of Merewalh of the Magons©¡tan, in western Shropshire.[REPLACEDREPLACED] He returned to East Anglia in about REPLACED.[REPLACEDREPLACED]
Soon after REPLACED, when Penda made his son Peada the ruler of the Middle Angles (but still continued to rule his own country),[REPLACEDREPLACED] the Mercian assault on East Anglia was repeated. The opposing armies of Penda and Anna met at Bulcamp, near Blythburgh in Suffolk. The East Anglians were defeated and many were slain, including King Anna and his son Jurmin.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Anna's death is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in the entry for REPLACED or REPLACED, "Her Anna cining wer©£ ofslagen ..." ? 'Here Anna was killed' ? but no other details of the battle in which he died are given.[REPLACEDREPLACED][note REPLACED] A drawing of the writing-tablet found near a possible monastic site at Blythburgh Blythburgh, a mile from Bulcamp and situated near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards believed to be the location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin.[REPLACED][REPLACEDREPLACED] It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Part of an REPLACEDth century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.[REPLACEDREPLACED]
Saint Botolph began to build his monastery at Icanho, now conclusively identified as Iken, Suffolk,[REPLACEDREPLACED] in the year that Anna was killed, possibly to commemorate the king.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Anna was succeeded in turn by his two brothers ¨¡thelhere and ¨¡thelwold, who may have ruled jointly.[REPLACEDREPLACED] It is possible that ¨¡thelhere was set up as a puppet ruler by Penda or was his ally, as he was one of the REPLACEDREPLACED duces that accompanied Penda when he attacked Oswiu of Northumbria at an unidentified location called the Winw©¡d in REPLACED or REPLACED. Penda himself was killed at the Winw©¡d, after having steadily increased his power over a period of REPLACEDREPLACED years.[REPLACEDREPLACED] ¨¡thelhere (who was also slain at the Battle of the Winw©¡d) and ¨¡thelwold were succeeded by the descendants of Anna's youngest brother, ¨¡thelric.[REPLACEDREPLACED]
Bede praised Anna's piety in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People,[REPLACEDREPLACED] and modern historians have since regarded Anna as a devout king,[REPLACEDREPLACED] but his reputation as a devoted Christian is mainly because he produced a son and four daughters who were all made into Anglo-Saxon saints.[REPLACEDREPLACED] Five hundred years after his death, his tomb at Blythburgh was (according to the Liber Eliensis) still "venerated by the pious devotion of faithful people".[REPLACEDREPLACED]
